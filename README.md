# Enigmaths Puzzles by IMA
I've been using scripts to help me generate and then eliminate all possible solutions to the (numerical) puzzles released by the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA).

These are published by the IMA, and I am but a lowly code monkey that attempts to solve the puzzles. I take no responsibility for wrong solutions. If anyone wants to use this code to make themselves better solvers for _fun_, feel free to do so. If you win anything from using my code, let me know!

Please feel free to put in pull requests, or raise issues.
