# Experimentation: Creating my own puzzle

I want to try making my own unique Enigmaths Puzzle, hopefully for it to get featured in a future edition of the magazine. Here is a list of design needs:

1. No zeroes
2. Interesting grid
3. Use mathematical clues/properties (palindrome, square, cube, triangular)

# Thoughts: Triangular shape
16 digits trapped in a a triangle (4 x 4)
1D = acgm
2A = bcd
2D = bfl
3D = dhn
4A = efghi
4D = ek
5D = io
6A = jklmnop
Left Diagonal: acbfekj
Right Diagonal: acdhiop
