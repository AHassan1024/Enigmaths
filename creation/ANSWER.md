# Experimentation: Creating my own puzzle

I want to try making my own unique Enigmaths Puzzle, hopefully for it to get featured in a future edition of the magazine. Here is a list of design needs:

1. No zeroes
2. Interesting grid
3. Use mathematical clues/properties (palindrome, square, cube, triangular)

# Thoughts: Triangular shape
16 digits trapped in a a triangle (4 x 4)
1D = acgm != 1728
2A = bcd
2D = bfl
3D = dhn
4A = efghi
4D = ek
5D = io
6A = jklmnop
Left Diagonal: abcefjk 
Right Diagonal: acdhiop

The three diagonal borders of the triangle are also triangular.


The four internal triangles sum up to a triangular number, because.... I'm evil. 


Might be useful to have 2 and 3 digit lists of interesting numbers to help narrow down the possibilities in future.
